# Instructions  

Write a program that will input temperatures for consecutive days. The program will store these values into an array and call a function that will return the average of the temperatures. It will also call a function that will return the highest temperature and a function that will return the lowest temperature. The user will input the number of temperatures to be read. There will be no more than 50 temperatures. Use `typedef` to declare the array type. The average should be displayed to two decimal places.

1. Input temperatures for consective days
2. store in array
    for ( count = 1; count <= Num_days; count++)
        {
            cout <<" Enter the number of days "
            << count << ": ";
            cin >> hours[count - 1];
        }
